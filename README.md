# Turtle Crossing Game
1. A turtle moves forward when you press the "Up" key. It can only move forwards, not back, left or right.
2. Cars are randomly generated along the y-axis and randomly moves from right edge of the screen to the left edge.
3. When turtle hits top of the edge screen, it moves back to the original position and player levels up. On the next level, the car speed increases.
4. When turtle collides with a car, it's game over and everything stops.
